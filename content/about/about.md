Other than being a homage to _Cones of Dunshire_ in _Parks and Recreation_, "My Humble Farmer" is also a blog that chronicles my rekindling with tabletop role-playing games and my recent discovery of board games. Here I will showcase my solo role-playing sessions, my impressions at the table and while reading about games and maybe even chronicling my first delves into game design.
