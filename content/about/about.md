Other than being a homage to [_Cones of Dunshire_ in _Parks and Recreation_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etPLaJWVPY4), "My Humble Farmer" is also a blog about my rekindling with tabletop role-playing games and my discovery of board games. Here I will showcase my role-playing sessions (both in groups and solo), my impressions at the table and while reading games, and maybe even chronicling my first forays into game design.
